planet "Bronze Hammer"
	attributes sheragi
	landscape land/badlands4
	description `While at first glance the planet of Bronze Hammer seems to be devoid of interest, desolate, and empty of all living things, further investigation reveals moss and lichen growing on the surface. Underneath each landing pad lies a special bunker for protection against asteroid impacts; beneath those is a bustling city and manufacturing planet.`
	description `	According to rumor, the few outfits available to civilians are only a foreshadowing of the massive industrial capacity of the Bronze Hammer.`

	description `The governors on Diamond Sword are open about the unpleasant fact that the planet is purely a military base. On one side of the spaceport are massive arsenals; on the other side are huge tanks of fuel.

	landscape land/forest10
	description `A land of hills covered in verdure next to calm seas and rolling waves makes Emerald Shield a georgeous place to create a major manufacturing center. The inhabitants seem to think so too; the planet is the biggest trading base in Sheragi space, despite its remote location.`
	description `	However, rumor has it that not all is peaceful. Beneath the green hills lies a hidden armada of warships, preparing to either defend the planet - at all costs - or conquer all of Sheragi space in the name of the Independents.`
