planet "Bronze Hammer"
	attributes sheragi
	landscape land/badlands4
	description `While at first glance the planet of Bronze Hammer seems to be devoid of interest, desolate, and empty of all living things, further investigation reveals moss and lichen growing on the surface. Underneath each landing pad lies a special bunker for protection against asteroid impacts; beneath those is a bustling city and manufacturing planet.`
	description `	According to rumor, the few outfits available to civilians are only a foreshadowing of the massive industrial capacity of the Bronze Hammer.`

planet "Clouded Ingot"
	attributes sheragi
	landscape land/forest6
	description `Clouded Ingot sees the sun rarely. Huge fog banks surround the single inhabited continent, and large belts of smog mark city locations.`
	description `	This planet also hosts the capital, the warship assembly lines, the cargo facilities, and the only outfitter in Independent space. Due to this, the Peace Party maintains a large trade fleet on the world, and Clouded Ingot serves as the major objective for War Party expeditionary forces, all of which have - so far - failed in their attempts.`
	spaceport `Visibility in the spaceport is close to zero. Distinguishing the ship on the next landing pad is difficult, and identifying the one beyond well-nigh impossible. However, underground, where the trading counters, job board, and bank reside, viewing range increases dramatically.`
	spaceport `	Given the cloudy nature and underground recesses on this planet, an invasion force would need to be prepared to fight a guerilla war if they wished to entirely subjugate the planet.`

planet "Copper Bow"
	attributes sheragi
	landscape land/fields15
	description `Copper Bow is the last planet on the path to Independent space, but this doesn't seem to have negatively affected the amount of trading that goes on. Most say that Copper Bow handles the second largest amount of traffic, in raw tons, of any Sheragi planet.`
	description `	For some reason, an enterprising Sheragi group painted an entire swath of the planet's many trees and grasslands in a strange, twisting, green and blue shape. Nobody knows quite why.`
	spaceport `The outfitter here stocks every single outfit the Sheragi still mass-produce. Some say that Emerald Swords are still made here, but in secret. How they obtained this secret information, nobody has thought to ask.`
	spaceport `	Given the fact that Copper Bow is right between War Party and Independent space, it would be a prime target for raiders of both sides, should the Peace Party ever declare war.`

	description `A land of hills covered in verdure next to calm seas and rolling waves makes Emerald Shield a georgeous place to create a major manufacturing center. The inhabitants seem to think so too; the planet is the biggest trading base in Sheragi space, despite its remote location.`
	description `	However, rumor has it that not all is peaceful. Beneath the green hills lies a hidden armada of warships, preparing to either defend the planet - at all costs - or conquer all of Sheragi space in the name of the Peace Party.`

planet "Gold Blade"
	attributes sheragi

	description `The Sheragi must have a good reason for continued inhabitance of this planet. Massive deserts stretch further than the eye can see. Perhaps the desert is caused by the miniature star that orbits the planet.`
	description `	Gold Blade is the War Party's main economic base. On this planet are the massive factories that churn out warships in the hundreds. On this planet also are the complicated gas giant fuel harvesting stations that supply both the Peace Party and the War Party.`
	description `	If those two ever declare war on each other, the Peace Party will have to find some way of producing their own hyperspace fuel.`

	description `	Any reason for inhabiting this planet is unclear. While the landscape provides great natural beauty when viewed from the interior of a spaceship, on the outside cold air chills you to the bone. Regardless of this, several permanent settlements have been made, and more are expected.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is clustered together inside one huge, heated building. Given that the inhabitants of this planet do not mass-produce any sort of outfit or spaceship, there is room for several large food deposits and metal blocks. All seems peaceful, and there is hardly a quarter of the bustle of Emerald Shield.`
